Backprobagation:
Backpropagation is an algorithm that back propagates the errors from output nodes to the input nodes. Therefore, it is simply referred to as backward propagation of errors. It uses in the vast applications of neural networks in data mining like Character recognition, Signature verification, etc..

There are two metods for handling missing data:
 one is delete the data
 another one is fill mean values for data
 if missing values is high better to delete the null values to model fit.
 the two type of missing handling method based on our situation.
